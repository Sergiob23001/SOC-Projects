# SOC-Projects
Hi there! I´m Sergio, a passionate Project/Program Manager in Cybersecurity based in Spain. I´ve created this repository as I want to move to a SOC Analyst position.

I´m constantly learning and enhancing my skills through online courses, certifications and projects.

I´m looking to collaborate on exciting projects, contributing with my skills in a team environment. I believe in the power of collaboration and contribution to create solutions, fix issues, deliver resutls and have fun.

I´m creating a Portfolio of Projects (Hands-On) to master practical cyber skills. 

Let me share them with you...
